# JotDown (Selected Contributions)

This repository contains selected Swift files from *JotDown* — a note-taking iOS app built with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Foundation model-based categorization. I contributed to key areas of the app including:

- UI layouts and view styling (`HomeView`, `ProfileView`, `SearchView`, etc.)
- Thought selection, editing, and multi-select deletion logic  
- Widget support and entry points for home screen interactions  
- Category logic: automated assignment based on text content  
- Search logic, combining user thoughts and metadata into searchable results  

### Features I Worked On

- ✅ Custom thought card views with selection state
- ✅ Widget interfaces for quick note entry and display
- ✅ Multi-select UI + batch delete actions
- ✅ Search logic across categories and thoughts
- ✅ Category filtering and archived views

### Files Included

This repo includes only the specific Swift files and logic that I built or significantly contributed to.
