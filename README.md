# JotDown-iOS-App-Showcase
About this Repository
This repository contains selected portions of the JotDown iOS note-taking app that I contributed to as part of the Georgia Tech iOS Club. The full project is a collaborative effort and is not shared here to respect team ownership, but this repo highlights the key components I implemented individually. These include:

Custom UI layout and animations

App Shortcuts & Home Screen widgets (via App Intents & WidgetKit)

Multi-selection and editing logic

Category-based filtering with SwiftData queries
