# JotDown-iOS-App-Showcase
This repo contains selected portions of the JotDown iOS project I contributed to as part of the Georgia Tech iOS Club. The full source code is not shared here to respect the collaborative nature of the project, but this repository showcases key components I implemented: UI layout, shortcuts, widgets, selection and edit logic, and category filtering logic.
